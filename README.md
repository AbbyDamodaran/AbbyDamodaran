Hi, Iâ€™m Abby ðŸ‘‹ 
Some of the simple iOS apps I built with Swift are public if you want to take a peek
I'm consolidating what I've learned so far at coding bootcamp & my software engineering internship in the form of a blog. Meanwhile, for any questions you can reach me at abby.damodaran@gmail.com -- I'd love to help out in any way!
